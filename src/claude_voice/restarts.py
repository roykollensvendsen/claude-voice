"""Why the bridge last restarted, kept so its health answer can say so.

A starting process cannot see why its predecessor stopped. So whoever restarts it on
purpose (the updater, or `claude-voice restart`) writes a small reason file first, and
the next start reads it once and deletes it. Without a fresh file, systemd's count of
automatic restarts and the machine's uptime tell a crash and a boot apart from the rest.

Every function takes the state folder, and everything it asks of the computer, as
arguments, so tests never touch systemd, git or the owner's own files.
